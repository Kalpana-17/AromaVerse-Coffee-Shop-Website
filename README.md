# ☕️ AromaVerse - where every Blend tells a Story
This project was done under the assignment by **[Social Prachar Coaching Center](https://socialprachar.com/)**.
AromaVerse website project helps to showcase my learning and understanding on frontend languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap framework. This project implements core features commonly seen in e-commerce websites, including a home page, login page, items page, cart, and contact page. This approach allows me to stay aligned with industry trends while gaining practical insight into how markets and businesses adopt these features.

## 🚀 Features
In this project, the main focus was to build faster website through bootstrap and customize accordingly using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The website has the following pages:
- 🏠 Home : A quick glimpse into the website and the world of coffee.
- ☕ AV’s Coffee Store – Showcasing coffees and croissants, with space for customization on order.
- 📩 Contact Us – Provides contact details and a form for queries.
- 🔐 Login / Register – User authentication and registration handled via browser local storage (no backend integration).
- 🛒 Cart – Displays selected items with a bill summary and a “Proceed to Pay” feature that opens a new tab, which generates a fake invoice to download after a successful order placement.

## 🎯 Goals of this project are:
- To design a responsive and user-friendly website using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- To create an engaging coffee store experience with a variety of coffees and croissants.
- To provide customization options so users can personalize their coffee choices.
- To implement basic user authentication (login/register) using browser local storage.
- To integrate a cart and billing system with a mock invoice generation feature.
- To deliver a smooth navigation flow across pages, making the website fast and efficient.
